It has been quite a while since I have posted some updates to this old blog of mine. I will be more active on this personal blog, because well I think I need to have a personal blog. I know it seems kinda bad as running an opensim grid, and having my own personal thoughts xD but you know what, I don't care. I support the freedom of speech and free flow of thought. Â So I will be posting my little rants here, my thoughts, and ideas for opensim. Now they will not always directly reflect my views on Cyber Wrld, I will say this I do plan on keeping Cyber Wrld a free and Open Source grid. We just run stable releases of OpenSim instead of bleeding edge, and we have support for currency and voice grid wide. We are still supporting those who want to try hosting their own regions with us.

I will be writing a bit more here and there about virtual worlds in general, rather opensim ones really.
