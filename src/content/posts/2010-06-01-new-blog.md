Hello this is your friendly OSgrid Folf (fox/wolf) who loves to explore the grid and help out those who I can. I want to start off by saying this blog has no official connection to OSgrid nor its operations. I am just here righting about my experiences in OSgrid and how much I enjoy it and helping people out in it.

I would first off like to think two special people off the back Lila and Vincient for all the hospitality they have shown me on OSgrid. Lila has provided me with land and Vincient has built the Gay Furries an amazing club (and I mean amazing). I have been getting to know them more and more, and recently I have been promoted to help Lila give out land, so if you're looking for land and Lila is not online or your just looking for a plot of free land for a home ect. Just hit me up in OSgrid, I would love to help you guys out. Thank you and have a great amazingly awesome day!
