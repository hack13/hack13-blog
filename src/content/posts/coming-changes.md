>Me reading in our new office location in OSgrid

As you might have heard, I have recently moved my entire grid to OSgrid. This was a decision made my grid residents, and I was inclined to agree as I want to go back to focusing on community related efforts for the HyperGrid. So moving everything to OSgrid, allows me to not worry about any of the issues, just worry about all the work I need to get done for the community.

I am not just working on the furry community for the hypergrid, but I want to bring together everyone, all walks of life. I am still working on creating a site, that will help residents of all hypergrid enabled grids come together and interact on a social network level. I feel the reason we are all having troubles of the hypergrid, is we are all spread to thin. We need to increase ourselves in community, to do this we just need to pull all our numbers together.

I know that I cannot please everyone all the time, so I am still going to be offering some really nice deals on OSgrid region hosting. I will be introducing a few new features and places to the sites I have been wanting to work on for bringing the hypergrid community all together.
