I am tired of all the fighting over virtual worlds, I mean mainly the OpenSim grids. I hear people arguing over having the hypergrid turned off or that they allow anyone to make oar and iar backups of their creations. I do not mind this, I actually think this is a good thing. Variety helps economy, we shouldn't be a at throat competition with other grids, but rather friendly competition. I understand how some grids cannot be public, because they want the ultimate security. Yes this can be argued, but the best systems are systems with access restricted to public. Now in the since of contributing back, we do need to consider that some of these grids also have to stay closed source if they put in stuff that makes it work better, but the parts of code belong to another company and they are being leased for use only with a said grid. So I see it understandable, and I think it is good to see grids branch off and do their own thing, that's for them, and what their user base wants.</p> 
  
Now in the since of open community, we have to keep in mind that closed grids can still partake. They can contribute content in many ways. Either documentation, code, tips, and ticks. Now we also have grids that are open grids, but do not allow hypergrid access. I can understand how these grids work, they have a primary focus, and they are concerned with guests popping in, for example certain RP grids. Now for the others like mine, I understand full access via hypergrid is an amazing thing to have enabled!
  
So what about these fully open hypergrid enabled grids? Well I feel this one is more my choice, for example we see that's what I am running Cyber Wrld as. Now granted I like this for many reasons, but I will not go into all of them because that will be for another day. See I feel the hypergrid is more for those who enjoy the free exchange of going everywhere, letting people buy, sell, and share creations with people amongst all the grids out there. I just feel hypergrid is something that makes all our lives for people who are more in the mood to share with not just one community but everyone in all the grids who are also hypergrid enabled.
  
So all in all, I just want to let everyone know that the different types of grids are for different communities. Different people think different ones are more for them, but it is honestly all about what type of grid you are interested in. That is what is nice about opensim, if you can't find a grid that does what you want it to do, just make your own!
