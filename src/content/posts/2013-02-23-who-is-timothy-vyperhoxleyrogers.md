I just keep reading all this stuff about all these other grids, and the people who have influences there. Now that I am a grid owner, been making myself know more and more over the past year with all the things I have started. Grid-Press, SoftPaw Estates, Zetamex, and my latest AuroraScape. I will admit I am not perfect, hell I never even went to college! Also another zinger for all you people, did you all know that I am only 20 years old? This year I turn 21, on April 28th. Which surprises a lot of people when I tell them all that, but I did take some college classes in High School, because my school was merged with the local college (due to budget cuts) and got 3 certification, that don't mean crap now.

That was a lot of information in one paragraph, well I am still wanting to clear up some damage I feel that has been done on the opensim/aurorasim community with BDSM people. Yes there are some people who are in BDSM that take it way to far, and that is just crazy when that happens. I know that it easy for some to be brain washed, that it is physically possible. I am not into the full BDSM but more the S&M part, and still there you have to be careful. I should know, being a sub myself. I just hate saying it, but not long after the osgrid thing started, I saw a lot of kinda like very short, and small responses like they had to post it. I mean if I like something I am going to say more than I like, thank you! at least a sentence or two. But that wasn't the only part it was also all the same with tiny changes to the text, but all the same like robots.

I am on my personal account Timothy Vyper, on AuroraScape trying to start up a furry S&M community on Furry Mansion. I can't go into to much detail here, because well this is a PG blog, and want to play it safe. I believe I am already pushing the envelope by talking about BDSM on my blog. I just don't want people to think it is all bad, it provides an out let for people like me. There are people out there who have instinctive urges to do things, and as long as everyone is responsible and plays safe it is a good outlet. But then again I am one of the most open people I know, :p have two partners in RL that I live with and all.

Anyways, that is all I had to say.
