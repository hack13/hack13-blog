title: Needing Rest
description: It sure has been a long first 20 days, I can't believe how far all of us have come. Yes after the upgrade happened, we lost a nice chunk of regions, but I am sure we will be getting them back soon. All I can say is I am taking a few steps back for the next few days, from grid upgrades.

It sure has been a long first 20 days, I can't believe how far all of us have come. Yes after the upgrade happened, we lost a nice chunk of regions, but I am sure we will be getting them back soon. All I can say is I am taking a few steps back for the next few days, from grid upgrades. I will still be around, doing money cash outs, trouble shooting, and processing orders. I just need a break.

I have been working so hard on the grid, that I got myself sick. I mean physically sick, but I am doing better now, I am just stepping back for a bit. It is really hard running this big grid's back end with just one other volunteer, I been drinking my weight in soda pop(not a coffee man). I tell you if it wasn't for Walmart brand dr. pepper, AuroraScape would suffer from it.

Anyways, I have been working on my own regions recently on my personal account in world. Feel free to add me _Timothy Vyper_ I like having friends. I am also working on some other features for customers of my Zetamex service. Which helps me fund AuroraScape and my caffeine addiction. I am always working hard to make a better world for you, and from the recent response people be giving me, I think you all are loving it.

I shall now retreat to my residence in AuroraScape, and continue to work on this castle for me and others to enjoy. I will see you all around, and I thank you all for your support. I will be back in full swing next week, so let us all relax and hang out together in world.
