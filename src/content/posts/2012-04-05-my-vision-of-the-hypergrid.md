I have been thinking for a long time, and you know I think I have my idea of how I really want Cyber Wrld to use the HyperGrid, and well I have been doing it already in a sense. But here it is, a way for people to come hang out on our grid. Not only that, have our grid as a shopping destination. We use OMC, letting people come to our grid and purchase items in world, even without an OMC account and pay through paypal. Take the stuff back home, or just come to our grid directly and sell stuff here and go out and explore. I mean I sound like I am plugging my grid here, but that is what I envision for Cyber Wrld. Being a hub for shopping, visitors, parties and more. I mean we are fully open for leaving our grid and coming back home, nothing too dangerous there.

I like Hyperica, it is an amazing place to go and find new jumps to go visit. We want to be a grid that is open for everyone to go and have fun and enjoy every point. We are working on our own directory of locations, we will be sorting them in several categories. Because of this, we cannot use the standard search engine for our viewers. We are working on a HUD that will let you search for content, so no matter where you are you can get your information. Being a part of the hyper grid makes us like just one big grid, all our stuff shared together. We should come together as one big old community, while still being free to go and explore other fun and exciting things.
