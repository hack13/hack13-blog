Thank You AuroraScape Community,

In the short 13 days since our very rough start, we have already hit a number of 67 registered residents, 51 Regions, and an average concurrency of 5-9 people online at any time. This is something that really impresses me for us only being 13 days old. I don't think I could have been any happier with the results of the opening of AuroraScape.

I am so excited, just logging in. I see this wonderful welcome area that has slowly been being filled with residents content. I would still love to see more resident's stuff here in world filling up these shops. But with working with everyone and seeing everything looking so clean and cut.

All of Linda Kellie's collections of furries, zoomtada's, and human avatars available upon login so you can get rid of that ugly ruth body. I have to say I can't think of a single grid that I have seen so many furries in, I am completely being serious here, I have seen so many furries apart of this community here as well as humans.

All our meetings currently being held around the fire in the Welcome area, it is quite cozy with all those pillows and many different custom sits and lays, put in by our very own resident Mia Destiny. Our first grid meeting we ran out of seating, this time was have added plenty more pillow for everyone!

Lastly the part that makes me the happiest person ever, is seeing you guys calling this grid home. Putting up your house and moving in, this is what makes me the happiest person ever. I really hope to see more of you guys move in and call AuroraScape your home too.

Thank you all so much for making AuroraScape a success, this is YOUR GRID, and I mean that. I have a Terms of Service, and require you to be 18+, but I do this because I want us to have a grid that we can make sure is going to be around for a long time to come. Remember that this grid will become what you make it. Remember that, as you all are the key components of this grid's success.

Thank You with Love,
