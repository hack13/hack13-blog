I just really want to take a step back and say I was really happy to see the new site by InWorldz. It looks very nice, however I only have one complaint... When launching a new theme, I would really like to see it implemented throughout before released to the public... Because the second you login, you are redirected to a part of the site of the old design. From what I saw only the home page contains the new theme.

Anyways, other then the fact it is only on the home page... I love the new design and I hope they roll it out to the rest of the site. I want to see more grids have modern design sites. So kudos to the InWorldz team!
