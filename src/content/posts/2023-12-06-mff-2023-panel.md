It was a major blast being able to run a panel at MFF, it allowed me to meet up with several others and spread the word about how wonderful the Fediverse actually is. Thanks to [Sky from yiff.life](https://yiff.life/@sky) for recording it for me allowing me to put it up on my site here for people to watch, and the power point presentation as well is posted below. I have hosted it on my CDN so it should be a quick load for everyone, which is Bunny by the way.
