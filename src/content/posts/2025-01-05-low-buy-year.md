So I am dealing with a with the issue of a form of "Retail Therapy" that I been doing over the past year. This has pushed me into debt, nothing I cannot get myself out of but... I shouldn't have gotten myself into in the first place. So this year I wanna focus on trying not to buy anything, and actually start budgeting. I know it is a silly thing to do every year, to do some sorta resolution, but then fail partly through the year and not keeping yourself accountable... but I am hoping to keep myself accountable this year.

With that said, my biggest goal for this year is to claw myself out of most of my debt. I know I will not get out of all of it... but I want to at least stop purchasing things on Credit Cards (that I don't pay off monthly), and also focus on getting some sort of decent emergency fund so I don't need to worry about getting back in debt if I screw up too badly.

Now, I do wanna go into a few other resolutions I want to try and accomplish for this year. These things are stuff I don't know if I can accomplish, but they are mainly for setting goal posts for myself, and I hope to use this blog as a way of keeping myself accountable.

My Main Goals
- Focus on getting out of debt
- Write at least two blog posts a month on this blog
- Go to the gym at least 3 times a week
- Work on coding projects
  - FurryFediverse
  - D.A.M. (Digital Asset Manager)
  - Personal Site

Stretch Goals
- Create videos to upload at least once a month
- Launch some paid services from CyberFurz to hopefully make self-sustainment
