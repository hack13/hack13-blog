Well, it has been a while since I have been around. I have deleted some of my social media presence because it is needed for how I been feeling. For those who do not know, I work as my primary job these days a UNIX/Linux System Administrator. Which has turned into something that has been a very demanding job that I wasn’t aware of?

I am very much enjoying my new job as a System Administrator and it has been greatly expanding my skills and learning more about managing Linux and UNIX servers at larger scales. However, that being said I put in tons of hours now and outside of those hours I spend a bunch of time studying for required certifications to further my career. That being said, it is the reason I haven’t been around much.
  
To claim that is the only reason, would be kind of a lie. My life has changed somewhat in the last few months, finally, I have got into a stable relationship with someone who actually cares about me as well. However, being in a stable relationship has led me to realize I have other issues with myself that I am now working on that are related to depression and stress in my life trying to juggle too many things. That I really need to pull back and adjust my priorities and stop committing myself to more then I can do.

That being said, the job that pays to keep the lights on and a roof over my head takes precedence over my other projects. Because the work I do, I am required to study and pass so many certification courses a year to keep myself properly employed. I have had to turn some of my focus to working on that, which I thought I was giving enough time too, however, I recently failed my AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associates Exam scoring only a 68% overall score. Thus loosing out on a bonus my company was offering to those who passed it a nice one-time bonus for passing before the end of the year.

So what does this mean for me? Well, to be honest, I am not really sure… I am doing my best to get my certifications I need. I am currently working on the AWS SysOps for my re-take and then I am needing to get back and finish my RedHat Certified System Administrator certifications as well. So, studying for both of those exams right now is keeping me quite the busy fox. However, all of this kinda saddens me and upsets me… because I really enjoy working on other things like OpenSimulator and other small open source projects I am interested in like OpenNIC. I really don’t know what the future holds for me right now, but I am doing my best to get through what I got on my plate right now.

I hope everyone understands why I haven’t been around much, and deleting my Google Plus because it was really bothering me seeing all the stuff people are doing with the projects I like and I just not having the time or ability to get involved in them like I used to. Anyways, I will continue to push forward and try and get back into things.
